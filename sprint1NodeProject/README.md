# sprint1NodeProject

This project is located in the sprint1 repository.

It consists of code to be tested and matching tests developped 
within the JEST framework.

Original code to be tested: ./app

Testing code folder:  ./__tests__ 

### TEST EXECUTION:

Test framework: Jest
Execution lines for the tests:

npm test 
npm run test


### 1.6.1 
 **Task 1.1:**
Create a file with basic calculation functions 
(sum, substract, multiply, and divide) and create a test .

Original code (calculus functions): app/calculator.js

Test functions: __tests__/calculate.test.js
Test output: checks if the calculus functions turn back the correct answer.

**Task 1.2:**
Create the necessary tests for checking the execution of the Async/Await level 1.1.

Original code (getter Functions): app/getEmployee.js
Test functions: __tests__/getEmployee.test.js

Test output: checks if the getEmployee and getSalary return the correct values.

**Task 1.3**
Create the necessary test checking the execution of Async/Await level 2.1

Original code (getter Functions): app/sprintFinished.js
Test functions: __tests__/sprintFinished.test.js

Test output: Checks if the sprintFinished function returns correct answer when invoked, and after the expected time setting (2 s) using Jest fake Timers.

**Task 1.4**
Create the necessary tests for checking the execution of Promises and Callbacks level 2.3
Original code (getter Functions): app/getEmployee2.js
Test functions: __tests__/getEmployee2.test.js

### 1.6.2
Create a mock que checks the calls to the Person class constructor and the method sayName of Classes and Arrow Functions level 2.2

Original code (Person Class with sayName function): app/sayName.js
Test functions: __tests__/sayName.test.js

Test output: The test creates a mock of the sayName.js file. (The mock is purged between the tests with beforeEach function). Checks how many times the function is invoked and some of its properties.
